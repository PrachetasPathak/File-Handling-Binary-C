# File-Handling-Binary-C
A C program demonstrating binary file handling by copying a file from one location to another.
Binary File Handling in C
Overview
This repository contains a simple C program that demonstrates binary file handling operations. Specifically, it performs the task of copying a file from one location to another using binary mode. In binary file handling, the file is treated as a sequence of bytes, allowing for efficient data manipulation.

Purpose
In this project, we perform the following file operations in binary mode:

Creating a new file
Opening an existing file
Reading from a file
Writing to a file
Copying a file to a new location
The purpose of this project is to understand the basics of working with binary files and how data is stored in its raw binary format. Binary files are essential for storing data in its original format, unlike text files that store data as human-readable characters.

Features
Create and open binary files.
Copy a binary file from one location to another.
Read and write data from a binary file.
Delete a binary file (optional).
Requirements
A C compiler (e.g., GCC).
A text editor to modify the code (optional).
